# Precursor

> Per-topic AI chat interface for work follow-up, where each topic maps to a GitHub issue.

Precursor is a small, opinionated assistant for tracking work-in-progress
conversations alongside the issues they belong to. Every chat is scoped to a
**topic** that can be linked to (or create) a GitHub issue; the assistant uses
the issue body, comments, and labels as live context so newer updates outweigh
older ones.

## Highlights

- Collapsible, searchable, **tree-organized** topic sidebar
- Each topic optionally linked to a GitHub issue; issue labels tag the chat
- Multi-turn chat with **SSE streaming** and markdown rendering
- Powered by **GitHub Models** (OpenAI-compatible) with a mock provider for
  offline development
- **MCP both ways**: Precursor exposes its conversations as an MCP server *and*
  attaches external MCP tool servers per topic
- Single uvicorn process in production — FastAPI serves the API and mounts the
  built React SPA
- **Plugin-ready**: backend entry points + a frontend extension registry,
  designed for things like a future drawio preview/generator

## Quick start

Precursor uses **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** for everything Python —
environment, running, building, and releasing. Install it once
([instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)), then:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev           # backend: .venv + Python deps (uv manages the interpreter)
npm --prefix frontend install # frontend: Vite + React toolchain (needs Node.js)
cp .env.example .env
```

> [!NOTE]
> The dev server (`precursor --dev`) and the SPA build (`make build`) need
> **Node.js + npm**; the production runtime does not. `make sync` runs both
> install steps (`uv sync` + `npm install`) in one go.

**GitHub credentials (optional).** Precursor resolves a GitHub token in this
order: (1) a token saved in **Settings → GitHub**, then (2) your **GitHub
CLI** session (`gh auth token`) if you're signed in via `gh auth login`. So if
you already use `gh`, you don't need to set anything. A token needs the
`models:read` fine-grained permission (or Copilot access) for real model
responses. With **no** token at all, Precursor falls back to the `MockProvider`
so the chat flow stays usable offline.

### Run it (one command)

```bash
uv run precursor --dev        # uvicorn --reload + Vite HMR (Ctrl-C stops both)
# or:  make dev
```

On startup Precursor prints a banner with the URL to open. In `--dev` the UI
runs on the **API port + 1** (Vite proxies `/api` to the backend), so a single
`--port` controls everything:

```bash
uv run precursor --dev --port 9000   # UI on :9001, API on :9000
uv run precursor --port 8100 --open  # prod-style, opens the browser when ready
```

**Running several instances at once?** Just pick a different `--port` per
instance — or don't: a busy port automatically bumps to the next free one (pass
`--strict-port` to fail instead, or `--port 0` to grab any free port). The
banner always tells you where the UI landed.

`uv run` resolves the project's environment on the fly — no manual activation.
Other entry points:

```bash
uv run precursor                     # single process: API + pre-built SPA on one port
uv run precursor --dev --no-frontend # backend only (uvicorn --reload)
npm --prefix frontend run dev        # Vite only
```

### Frontend prod build (served by FastAPI)

```bash
make build                    # npm --prefix frontend run build → frontend/dist
uv run precursor              # serves API + SPA on :8000
```

The single-process run needs the SPA pre-built; `uv run precursor` then serves
it from `frontend/dist`. The SPA is also bundled **inside the wheel**, so an
installed build is self-contained:

```bash
uvx precursor                 # run the latest published wheel, zero setup
# or pin it:  uv tool install precursor && precursor
```

### Automatic upgrades on startup

When you pull new code or upgrade Precursor, both the **frontend** and
**database** are automatically upgraded when the app starts — no manual build
or migration steps needed:

- **Frontend**: Built automatically if `frontend/dist` is missing or stale
- **Database**: Migrations applied during app startup via Alembic

Just start Precursor and it handles the rest:

```bash
git pull
uv run precursor              # frontend built + DB migrated automatically
```

## Design principles

- **Streaming-first** chat with tool-call visualization
- **Single process** in production — no Node.js runtime required
- **Each topic is an independent conversation context**, hydrated from its
  linked GitHub issue (newer comments preferred over older)
- **Extensible by design**: see [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md) for the
  plugin contract — third parties can mount routers, contribute frontend
  panels, and register MCP tools without forking the core

## Security & deployment model

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Precursor is designed as a **single-user, local-first** app and ships with
> **no authentication**. Run it bound to `127.0.0.1` (the default) and do not
> expose it to a network or the public internet without putting your own
> authenticating reverse proxy in front of it.

Specific things to keep local:

- The API and SPA have **no auth** — anyone who can reach the port has full
  access to your topics, settings, and stored tokens.
- The optional **command-runner** MCP tool can execute shell/Python/Node. Keep
  the Docker "jail" enabled; disabling it grants full local-disk access.
- The built-in **MCP-over-HTTP** transport is off by default and only binds to
  loopback — leave it that way unless you front it with auth.
- Secrets (the GitHub token, LLM provider keys) live in the local DB (set via
  Settings) and are never echoed by the API. Don't commit `.env`.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting.

## Versioning & releases

Precursor uses **CalVer** (`YYYY.M.MICRO`, e.g. `2026.6.0`). The version is a
single source of truth derived from git tags by hatch-vcs at build time — there
is no literal to edit. The running version is exposed at `GET /api/version` and
shown in the Settings panel.

Releases ship from a pushed `v<version>` tag via GitHub Actions. See
[RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
